            My family eats at this tiny Italian restaurant in North Newark
            almost religiously. It has a screen door, awful wine selection, and
            waitresses who are abrupt at bestâ€”but the food is astounding.

            The best ones are reserved for special occasions, and our memories
            of birthdays and anniversaries are made there.
